 Local Variable:
 Local variable is a variable which we declare inside a Method.
 A method will often store its temporary state in local variables.

 Instance Variable (Non-static):
 Instance variable is a variable which is declared inside a Class but outside a Method.
 We donâ€™t declare this variable as Static because these variables are non-static variables.

 Class Variable (Static):
 Class variable is a variable which is declared as Static. Additionally, the keyword final
 could be added to include that the value will never change.
