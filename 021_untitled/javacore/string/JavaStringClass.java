 The Java platform provides the String class to create and manipulate strings.
 Strings are a sequence of characters. Java String class provides a lot of methods
 to perform operations on string such as compare(), concat(), equals(), split(), length(),
 replace(), compareTo(), intern(), substring() etc.
 String is an immutable object which means it is a constant and can cannot be changed once
 it has been created. In this tutorial we will learn about String class and String methods.
